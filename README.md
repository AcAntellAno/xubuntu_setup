# xubuntu_setup
My xubuntu set up (16.04, Xenial Xerus) ;)

So you decided to hop onto Xubuntu aye...you won't regret it! It's one of the most lightweight linux (debian) based OS's out there! 
First, install the script -> run this command in terminal and follow along when prompted (without the quotes):

#beginning of terminal commands

"wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klakar/geosupportsystem/master/configXubuntuArdvark.sh"

Then execute the script:

"sh configXubuntuArdvark.sh"

#end of terminal commands

Thank you geosupportsystem for sharing the script!
